== Create Store Credit Coupons for WooCommerce ==
The WooCommerce Gift Card plugin allows you to create store credit coupons for your WooCommerce store. Customers can use these store credits either fully or partially for their purchases, with the balance decreasing until the credit is fully used. You can assign each store credit coupon to specific users, providing greater control over your coupon campaigns and restricting unauthorized usage of store credits.

== Free Templates for WooCommerce Gift Vouchers == 
This free gift card plugin for WooCommerce offers four cool templates for gift card images. You can allow your customers to choose an image for the gift card from the given four templates. These templates feature a range of designs, from classic and elegant to festive and fun, ensuring a perfect match for every occasion and recipient. 

== Send Free Gift Cards to Customers ==
With the WordPress gift card plugin, you can send a gift card of any amount to your customers via email. You can even send them to multiple recipients and add a special message.

It's a nice chance to show your love to your customers by giving them a free gift card on special days like Christmas, New Year, or Thanksgiving. You can also give out gift certificates as a bonus for referrals from your customers.

You can enhance the WooCommerce gift cards by integrating with the [Smart Coupons for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wt-smart-coupons-for-woocommerce/) - an advanced coupon plugin for WooCommerce.

== Set Predefined Amount for Gift Card ==
You can add one or multiple predefined values for the gift card on your WooCommerce store. By creating a custom gift card of specific values, you encourage customers to spend a specific amount, which can lead to higher average order values. Customers might be more inclined to choose a slightly higher amount than they initially planned.

First Data’s U.K. Prepaid Consumer Insights Study found that the average consumer is spending more than the original value of the gift card. This trend is expected to grow in the coming years as the global gift card market is projected to hit $2,000 billion by 2027.

== Add Custom Message to WooCommerce Gift Cards ==
You can allow your customers to add custom gift card messages with the gift card email. So when they send a gift card to their loved ones, they can add a special message with the gift card. Custom gift card messages provide an opportunity to convey emotions, well wishes, or special sentiments. Whether it's for a birthday, holiday, or other occasion, a heartfelt message can significantly enhance the recipient's experience.

== Allow Customers to Send Gift Vouchers Anonymously ==
When purchasing a gift card from your store, a user can send the gift card anonymously to the recipient. The sender name and email address fields are not mandatory when sending a gift card. This adds a surprise element to the gift-giving experience. Recipients may not anticipate who the gift is from, creating excitement to identify the sender.

== Auto Generate Gift Cards for WooCommerce ==
The gift card generator plugin also auto-generates and send gift cards to the recipient's email address upon receiving a new gift card order, specifically when the order is in the <strong> Processing </strong> or <strong> Completed </strong> status.
